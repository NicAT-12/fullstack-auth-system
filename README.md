# Fullstack Authentication System

A full-stack authentication system built with React, Node.js, Express, MongoDB, JWT, and HTTP-only cookies.

This project was created to learn and practice the complete authentication flow used in modern web applications, including user registration, login, protected routes, profile access, and logout functionality.

## Features

* User Registration
* User Login
* JWT Authentication
* HTTP-only Cookies
* Protected Routes
* User Profile Page
* Logout Functionality
* Dark / Light Theme
* Form Validation
* Responsive Design

---

## Tech Stack

### Frontend

* React
* React Router DOM
* Sass (SCSS)
* Vite

### Backend

* Node.js
* Express.js
* MongoDB
* Mongoose
* JWT (JSON Web Tokens)
* bcrypt

## Authentication Flow

### Registration

```text
Register
↓
Validate data
↓
Hash password
↓
Store user in MongoDB
```

### Login

```text
Login
↓
Validate credentials
↓
Generate JWT
↓
Store JWT in HTTP-only cookie
```

### Protected Route

```text
ProtectedRoute
↓
Request user profile
↓
JWT validation
↓
Allow or deny access
```

### Logout

```text
Logout
↓
Clear authentication cookie
↓
Redirect user
```

## Environment Variables

### Frontend

Create a `.env` file inside `front-end`:

```env
VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:5000
```

### Backend

Create a `.env` file inside `backend`:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGO_URI=your_mongodb_connection_string
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret
NODE_ENV=development
```

---

## Installation

### Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/NicAT-12/fullstack-auth-system.git
```

### Backend

```bash
cd backend

pnpm install

pnpm start
```

### Frontend

```bash
cd front-end

pnpm install

pnpm dev
```

## What I Learned

Through this project I practiced and reinforced several full-stack development concepts:

* Building REST APIs with Express
* Working with MongoDB and Mongoose
* Password hashing with bcrypt
* JWT authentication
* Managing authentication with HTTP-only cookies
* Protecting routes in React
* React Router navigation and redirects
* Form validation on both frontend and backend
* Environment variable management
* Organizing scalable project structures
* Creating reusable React components
* Implementing responsive layouts with Sass
* Managing application themes (Light/Dark Mode)

---

## Future Improvements

* Authentication Context
* Refresh Tokens
* Email Verification
* Password Recovery
* User Roles and Permissions
* Better Error Handling
* Deployment (Vercel + Render/Railway)
